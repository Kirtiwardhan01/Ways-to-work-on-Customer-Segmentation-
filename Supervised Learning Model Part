Supervised Learning Model Part

Data is separated into training data and test data. 

However, for good results it must have good precision 

the performance of models are not good if it has resulted from the biased data distribution (label)


Improvement

In order to increase the performance of the supervised learning model, the following parts might be conducted.
1. The methods that deal with unbalanced data: under-sampling or over- sampling
2. Increase PCA components
3. Use only the PCA components as independent variables
