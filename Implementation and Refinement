From  (Say) N features,conduct PCA to extract import features of the general population 

Knowing the main explained variance for each attribute,decide how many components to selects based on variance 

amounts to ~ 95% of total variance (PCA = (no_compontes = N))



After selecting the main PCA componets, We can use KMeans method to apply clustering. 

In order to decide how many clusters to select then investigate the number of clusterings to the KMeans score

Say for example when the number of clusterings increases to about 30, 
the error (score) gets low enough and does not change rapidly. Therefore, I chose 30 as the number of clusterings
